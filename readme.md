This app was created for two purposes. 

First, it was created as a demo project for an online tutorial for dental surgery patients at Miami Children's Hospital (where my sister works.)

Second, I realized that many parents do not have an easy way to keep accurate records of how often their child is brushing/flossing/etc. The app doesn't currently have this functionality, but parents should be able to add it once this is complete. At this point, parents can add their children into the system. 

This also allows dental staff at the hospital to make an account and have easy contact info for the parents of their patients. 

Setting up is easy - just make an account. It is already deployed online on Heroku. 

Gems Used
Pry-Rails - for development. 

HTTParty - for adding a search function later. 

rails_12factor - for deployment to Heroku 

Devise - for user authentication.
